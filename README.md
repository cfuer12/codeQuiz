# codeQuiz

Create a quiz that displays a start button at the begining in which once pressed, it should start a timer and move onto the next page displaying the questions. 
I have made a set of questions that will be used for the quiz, and i have also made a timer....but i need to link it somehow to the start button...

Im having some difficulties in achieving this however so i have made a meeting with my tutor and see if he can help me out in acheiving and understanding how to type a code up in order to make it all work. I will probably re-submit this again later in the week.
